                        In my recent research project, the objective was to design a model capable of generating captions from video files, specifically those without audio. We employed a distance-based approach to predict actions between objects within the videos. The tools utilized for this project included Python, OpenCV, Yolo, and ChatGPT. This approach allowed us to effectively analyze and interpret the visual content, providing meaningful captions that describe the actions occurring in the silent videos. This research enhanced my skills in video analysis and machine learning, demonstrating the potential of combining advanced technologies for innovative solutions.                    </p>
